\subsection{Cable construction}
\subsubsection{Construction of ACT/E - Cable for motor encoder} \label{CONSTRUCTION:ACTE}
The encoder cable is supplied together with the motor combination (see section~\ref{DEVICE:COMBINATION1}). Instead of purchasing for 4.2 meters of cable for encoder, a better option is ordering 60cm for each ordered motor combination. One cable side comes already attached to the motor combination. However, the other side requires a 10-pin female connector for flat cable (section~\ref{DEVICE:10pinF(Encoder)}). Please follow these procedures and use figure~\ref{FIG:ACTEconstruction} as a reference:
\begin{itemize}
  \item (1) See that this encoder cable already comes with the motor combination. As mentioned in section~\ref{CABLETYPE:Electric(Encoder)}, order a 60cm length.
  \item (2) Leave a piece of cable/wire envelops striped at each cable end.
  \item (3) Install the 10pinF(Encoder) connector at the free cable side. Use the section~\ref{DEVICE:10pinF(Encoder)} as a reference for pinout. Use the procedures described at subsection~\ref{CRIMPING10pin} for the connector installation.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Construction of ACT/H - Cable for motor Hall effect sensor} \label{CONSTRUCTION:ACTH}
The Hall sensor cable is composed by 5 free wires, and it is supplied together with the motor combination (see section~\ref{DEVICE:COMBINATION1}). Instead of purchasing for 4.2 meters of cable for hall sensor, a better option is ordering 60cm for each ordered motor combination. One cable side comes already attached to the motor combination. However, the other side requires a Molex Micro-Fit connector (section~\ref{DEVICE:microHall}). Please follow these procedures and use figure~\ref{FIG:ACTHconstruction} as a reference:
\begin{itemize}

\subsubsection{Crimping Molex Micro-Fit 3.0\texttrademark Family} \label{CRIMPINGmicro}
For connecting wires to a Molex Micro-Fit 3.0\texttrademark connector from 43025-xxxx family (sections~\ref{DEVICE:microCAN} and~\ref{DEVICE:microHall}), you first need to crimp the edge of these wires in the Molex crimp terminal from 43030-xxxx family (section~\ref{DEVICE:microCrimp}). For this, you should perform the following steps:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Use the tool "Molex Hand Crimper Tool Part Number: 63819-0000" (see section~\ref{DEVICE:TOOLCRIMPERmicro}).
  \item For each wire to be connected, use a cutting plier (like the one described in section~\ref{DEVICE:TOOLPLIERCUTTING}), strip the wire envelop, leaving 2mm copper exposed.
  \item Place the wire and the crimp terminal according to figure~\ref{FIG:CRIMPmicro1}.
  \item Use the Molex Hand Crimper (item 1) to crimp the wire.
  \item If the crimping tool is not available, perform these steps:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Using a preheated soldering station (like the one presented in section~\ref{DEVICE:TOOLSOLDERINGSTATION}), tin the 2mm striped copper wire.
    \item Place the wire/crimp terminal like described in item 3.
    \item Use a long needle-nose plier (like the one presented in section~\ref{DEVICE:TOOLPLIERNEEDLENOSE}) to press the crimp flaps, following the steps described in figure~\ref{FIG:CRIMP2}.
    \item Using the preheated soldering station, touch the iron tip over the crimp terminal for long enough until the internal welding tin (on the wire tip surface) gets melted.
  \end{itemize}
  \item Repeat the previous steps for each wire.
  \item Envelop the whole wire set using 2cm of a heat shrink tube (like the ones described in section~\ref{DEVICE:TOOLTHERMALINSULATION}). Select the correct tube diameter according to your need. Use figure~\ref{FIG:CRIMP3} as a reference.
  \item Use the heat of a thermal blower (like the one described in section~\ref{DEVICE:TOOLTHERMALBLOWER}) to shrink the thermal tube around the cable/wires.
  \item Using the correct pinout for the concerning connector (which can be checked in section~\ref{DEVICE:CONNECTORS}), insert each crimped terminal into the respective connector hole. A "click" sound must be heard, and this indicates that the crimp terminal is in the correct plug position and cannot be removed. Use figure~\ref{FIG:CRIMP4} as a reference.

  \item For each wire to be connected, use a cutting plier (like the one described in section~\ref{DEVICE:TOOLPLIERCUTTING}), strip the wire envelop, leaving 3mm copper exposed.
  \item Place the wire and the crimp terminal according to figure~\ref{FIG:CRIMPmini5}.
  \item Use the Molex Hand Crimper (item 1) to crimp the wire.
  \item If the crimping tool is not available, perform these steps:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Using a preheated soldering station (like the one presented in section~\ref{DEVICE:TOOLSOLDERINGSTATION}), tin the 3mm striped copper wire.
    \item Place the wire/crimp terminal like described in item 3.
    \item Use a long needle-nose plier (like the one presented in section~\ref{DEVICE:TOOLPLIERNEEDLENOSE}) to press the crimp flaps, following the steps described in figure~\ref{FIG:CRIMP6}.
    \item Using the preheated soldering station, touch the iron tip over the crimp terminal for long enough until the internal welding tin (on the wire tip surface) gets melted.
  \end{itemize}
  \item Repeat the previous steps for each wire.
  \item Envelop the whole wire set using 2cm of a heat shrink tube (like the ones described in section~\ref{DEVICE:TOOLTHERMALINSULATION}). Select the correct tube diameter according to your need. Use figure~\ref{FIG:CRIMP7} as a reference.
  \item Use the heat of a thermal blower (like the one described in section~\ref{DEVICE:TOOLTHERMALBLOWER}) to shrink the thermal tube around the cable/wires.
  \item Using the correct pinout for the concerning connector (which can be checked in section~\ref{DEVICE:CONNECTORS}), insert each crimped terminal into the respective connector hole. A "click" sound must be heard, and this indicates that the crimp terminal is in the correct plug position and cannot be removed. Use figure~\ref{FIG:CRIMP8} as a reference.
