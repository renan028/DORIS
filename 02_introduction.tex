\chapter{Introduction}
This memorandum presents the executive project of DORIS electronics system. The main objective of this document is to provide: a) the description of the architecture of the embedded electronics subsystems on both DORIS and remote control base; b) the list of devices (and their manufacturers) that compose the system; c) detailed manual for the assembly, installation, testing and commissioning of the electronics system; d) detailed description of tests conducted in LEAD to validate parts of the system; e) summary of bibliographic references.

\section{Technical nomenclature}
Before continuing, we shall propose a technical nomenclature to use as standard in this memorandum: ESCREVER
%    \begin{itemize}
%        \item The robot and other major apparatus operating in the platform will be referred as \emph{electronic equipments} (e.g.: DORIS).
%        \item Computers and its associated components (storage, physical memory, motherboard) will be referred \emph{computers}. All the remaining electronic gadgets will be referred \emph{devices}.
%        \item Sensors, Cameras, Audio Systems and any other electronic equipment that performs data sensing from the environment will be referred \emph{Environmental Data Devices}. Lamps and other lighting devices are also in this category.
%        \item Switches, Access Points and any other hardware for communication/interface (e.g.: Data Acquisition Board, Interface adapters, etc.) will be referred \emph{Interface Devices}.
%        \item Environmental Data Devices and Interface Devices will compound together the \emph{Peripheral Devices}.
%        \item Any device for actuation purpose (e.g.: motors and drivers for mobile locomotion/manipulator) will be referred \emph{Actuation Devices}.
%    \end{itemize}
